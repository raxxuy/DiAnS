# Web scraping the Macedonian Stock Exchange
For this homework project, we developed a web scraper in Python to extract real-time stock data from the Macedonian Stock Exchange website. Using asynchronous programming with aiohttp and BeautifulSoup, the scraper retrieves company details and historical stock data directly from MSEâ€™s public pages. Collected data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, making it accessible for financial analysis and insights.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL (local or Docker-based)
- Docker (if using Docker to run the database)
